Accelerated Natural Language Processing - Coursework 1

This jupyter notebook contains my work done on the first coursework of the module Accelerated Natural Language Processing at The University of Edinburgh. The objective was to build a trigram language model from scratch. This was then used to generate sequences and to compute the perplexity of test documents.
